# Customer Segmentation Analysis for Data-driven Marketing Strategies
# Excel to Power BI


## Description: 
This is a Customer Segmentation Analysis Project that involves importing customer data from SQL, followed by data cleaning and transformation using Power Query. I also created interactive visualizations to identify distinct customer segments using Power BI. The main objective is to offer critical insights for informed business decision-making and the development of data-driven marketing strategies for my client.
